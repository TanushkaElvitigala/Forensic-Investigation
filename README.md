# Forensic-Investigation

The project involved analyzing a forensic disk image using Autopsy 4.21.0 and FTK Imager to uncover digital evidence related to potential illicit activities.

Key Activities & Methodologies:

Forensic Imaging & Analysis – Extracted and examined data from a forensic image file (.E01) using industry-standard tools.
Timeline Reconstruction – Constructed a digital timeline to trace user activities, including file access, downloads, and web searches.
Digital Evidence Collection – Identified key artifacts such as images, documents, and web history, which helped establish connections between individuals and illicit activities.
Data Integrity & Hashing – Verified data authenticity using cryptographic hash functions (MD5, SHA-256) to ensure evidence remained unaltered.
Running Sheet Documentation – Maintained a comprehensive log of forensic actions and findings to ensure transparency and maintain the integrity of the investigation process.

Outcome:
The investigation revealed crucial insights into potential unauthorized activities and digital footprints left by different user accounts. Findings were documented in a detailed forensic report, including metadata analysis, file categorization, and web activity patterns.

Key Takeaways:
This experience significantly enhanced my skills in digital forensics, cyber investigation, and incident response, advancing my expertise in the field of cybercrime investigations and the handling of digital evidence.
